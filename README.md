## Description:
Hospitals are the most important part of our lives, trying to provide the best medical facilities to people suffering from various type of illness, which may be due to change in climate conditions, increased work-load, emotional trauma stress etc. It is very much difficult for the hospital to maintain its day-to-day activities and records manually. That is why a database is required to keep records of all type of activities of a hospital.

## Problem Statement:
- Managing hospitality services, including room bookings, patients’ management, room allocations, and payments, often involves handling large volumes of data.
- Many small to medium-sized hospitals struggle with manual data management, leading to errors, double bookings, and poor patients’ service.
- This project aims to streamline operations by implementing an SQL-based system to manage all aspects of hospitality services efficiently.

## Objectives:
- The objective of this project is to design and develop an SQL-based Hospitality Management System that simplifies booking, room allocation, billing, and patients’ relationship management.
- The system will ensure data consistency, reduce human errors, and provide quick access to critical information for better decision-making.
